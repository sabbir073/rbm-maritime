        content: `<h3>Global Maritime Industry Year in Review</h3>

<p>Geopolitical developments often have a greater effect than market forces on the highly volatile shipping market. Beginning with the 2007–08 financial crisis, global shipping has faced a series of new challenges, with analysts tending to label each year more arduous than the one before. But the malevolent actions and worsening extreme weather conditions the industry encountered in 2024 are without match over the past decade and a half. The year's complications, contradictions, and calamities included the prolonged war in Ukraine, wanton Houthi attacks in the Red Sea, and rising tensions in the South China Sea. Meanwhile, piracy returned off the Somali coast, while climate change limited some operations through the Panama Canal—although operators there still registered record profits. Container ships avoided the Suez Canal and instead transported goods around southern Africa, a choice that increased transit time and greenhouse gas emissions. Yet, those container ships' owners enjoyed a profitable year.</p>

<p>November marked the one-year anniversary of the Red Sea crisis that began with the Houthis' seizure of the Galaxy Leader, as well as the 1,000th day of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Disruption in shipping activities has become routine. But the greater the disruption, the greater the need for commercial ships, so, for many shipowners, getting even one more voyage out of an old ship is now preferable to its demolition. This has led to an older world fleet and very little ship recycling. That does not mean shipbuilding has slowed, however. Builders contracted for a record-breaking number of new ships.</p>

<h3>The Global Shipping Market</h3>

<p>Maritime trade volume is expected to show a 2 percent increase for 2024, with 2.7 percent growth in container trade. This growth comes despite exceptionally daunting operating conditions, the worst effects of which are being felt by small-island developing states and least-developed countries. It was not long ago that shipping containers were revered as the boxes that changed the world—the backbone of a globalization that would foster long-lasting peace and prosperity for all, based on Ricardian comparative advantage theory. But visions of an interdependent global economy full of mutual benefits no longer seem ascendant.</p>

<p>Ship diversions caused by the threat of Houthi militants reportedly will lower Suez Canal transit revenues by as much as $7 billion for 2024, according to Egyptian government estimates, while the canal's users handed over $2 billion to the militants in safe transit fees. The energy trading house Trafigura estimated that tanker diversions around southern Africa in 2024 would raise fuel consumption by 200,000 barrels per day of oil, and ship emissions by 4.5 percent. The longer sailing distances doubled the average annual increase in ton-miles. The increasingly inefficient 2024 freight market kept most surplus ships employed and rewarded their owners handsomely, while the shortage of experienced mariners became sharper.</p>

<h3>Liner Market</h3>

<p>The Houthis in 2024 escalated their attacks on container ships in the Red Sea region. This redirected much of the region's regular traffic around southern Africa and increased the demand for ships. The increase in voyage costs was quickly passed on to customers, while ship operators' profits rose substantially.</p>

<p>A record 530 new container ships were estimated to enter the market in 2024, easily beating 2023's 350 new ships. Under normal circumstances, this sudden influx of capacity would push shipping rates much lower. But in retrospect, it looks like masterful foresight in sustaining resilience in global supply chains, although a return to normalcy might cause sudden financial distress and bankruptcy for some operators.</p>

<p>The liner market remains highly concentrated. The top ten companies control about 84 percent of the operating fleet. Mediterranean Shipping Company, the liner market leader, controls more than 20 percent. However, liner reputation for timely service plummeted in 2024, and schedule reliability was barely above 50 percent. All major operators are in the process of realigning their partnerships and positioning themselves strategically to meet new market trends. Market disruptions are expected to continue.</p>

<h3>Tanker Market</h3>

<p>Tankers experienced two major external disruptions: sanctions on Russian oil exports and the Houthi attacks in the Red Sea. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, more than 50 percent of typical tanker movements through the Red Sea were diverted around southern Africa in 2024 and generated larger ton-miles. Earnings for tankers are not comparable to those for liners, both because of differences in their market structures and competitive dynamics, and because of the operations of an expanding shadow fleet of tankers transporting sanctioned oil cargo.</p>

<p>The global demand for oil is now growing 1 percent annually and will reach its peak by 2030, according to the International Energy Agency. Outside countries in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East, demand is softening in major consumption economies, including China. The tanker market remains balanced only because of the Red Sea diversions, increased crude oil exports from the Americas (the U.S. Gulf Coast, Canada, Brazil, Guyana, and Argentina) to Asia, and the low number of new tanker deliveries in 2024. With deliveries projected to rise rapidly this year, the market's future is at the mercy of the Houthis.</p>

<p>The scrapping of older tankers in 2024 fell to its lowest level in three decades, and most old tankers are now part of a shadow fleet of about 1,000 ships suspected of carrying oil linked mainly to Russia, but also to Iran and Venezuela. These ships' ownership is difficult to trace; the vessels lack legitimate documentation and marine insurance.</p>

<h3>Dry Bulk Market</h3>

<p>The year began on a positive note for the dry-bulk sector, especially with the normalization of trade relations between China and Australia. The movement of iron ore and grain picked up, while coal shipments lagged. The bigger dry-bulk ships received the largest freight rate increase, and the market for used ships remained robust. Like other markets, the dry-bulk sector benefited from diversions around the Red Sea. But those gains were marginal and were not enough to offset lukewarm growth in China's economy, which had sustained dry-bulk prosperity in previous years. Market conditions are likely to weaken during the next two years as new ship deliveries increase and freight rates drop. This will result in increased scrapping of older ships, which reached a historically low level in 2024.</p>

<p>The grain export corridor established in 2023 along Ukraine's coastal waters and the territorial waters of Romania, Bulgaria, and Türkiye flourished during the first nine months of 2024. This alternative to the failed United Nations-brokered Black Sea Grain Initiative raised the volume of grain exports close to pre-war levels until Russia began deadly air attacks on innocent shipping movements in September. Ukraine has sought help from the International Maritime Organization (IMO) to restore freedom of navigation in the region and ensure the safety of its food exports.</p>

<h3>Shipbuilding</h3>

<p>New shipbuilding orders reached $188 billion during the first 11 months of 2024, according to Clarksons Research data. The average new-build price reached $90 million, twice the 2014 price. All major yards are now fully booked for the next four years. A surge in new construction after a few years of lackluster growth was expected, especially outside the container sector, because of the rising age profile of global fleets and increasing operating costs under new environmental regulations, including stricter emissions standards.</p>

<p>There are 180 major shipyards worldwide that build large, oceangoing ships, and 78 percent of them are in China. As of November, the Chinese order book for new builds dominated the market for traditional ships (90 percent of container ships, 81 percent of dry-bulk ships, and 72 percent of tankers), and Chinese companies also held half of all new gas-carrier orders. With a current order-book share of more than 65 percent of all ship types, they dwarf the combined 31 percent share of South Korea and Japan, their main competitors.</p>

<h3>Decarbonization Initiatives</h3>

<p>Climate and energy experts are skeptical about reaching the IMO goal for zero-emission fuels by 2030—a failure that could in turn put the target of net-zero emissions by 2050 further out of reach. Only 22 percent of the required actions are on track; the rest are either partially or completely off track. The goal to have new ships that enter service run on zero or near-zero greenhouse-gas fuels throughout their service life is still achievable, but it will require a more dedicated effort. The European Union's FuelEU Maritime regulations to promote the use of marine fuels with lower greenhouse-gas intensity went into effect on 1 January 2025. The European Union also implemented an emissions trading system that requires offsetting 40 percent of 2024 emissions in 2025, a proportion quickly rising to 100 percent by 2027.</p>

<p>The 82nd session of the IMO Marine Environment Protection Committee, held in November, saw an emerging consensus to establish a universal greenhouse-gas contribution system, for which the regulations are being developed. A World Bank report estimates that adopting a global carbon tax would generate $40 billion to $60 billion annually.</p>`,
